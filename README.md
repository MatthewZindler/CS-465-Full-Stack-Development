# CS-465-Full-Stack-Development
**Architecture**

  Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
    This project used the different layers of MEAN stack to apply to different parts of the project. Express HTML was used to make a user friendly UI with buttons, nav       bars, submission forms and arranging backgrounds and images. JavaScript was used to create many different methods that were called when a user interacted with the       SPA to change the presented content and make calls to the database. The website being a single page application also affects the front end, as when a user visits         they download and cache the website data. This allows them to change what content is presented to them with limited calls to the database and even allowing them to       browse offline.
  Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
    NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, are a lot more flexable than SQL databases. They are able to change data models, have faster queries and are easier for use to use     which is a big advantage for junior developers. Another benefit that is including is the fast updates that we did for this project: adding and editing trips, and         making frequent changes to the database throughout the module work is much more effecient on NoSQL databases.
    
**Functionality**

  How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    JSON is a syntax based off Javascript used to translate readable text into data objects for the server and database to better work with. Since it is a sort of           translation between the user/developer and the server/database it acts as the middle man between the two. We used it mainly for error messages, and handling data in     the database which is why we have error outputs in json as well as having trips written as json.
  Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user       interface (UI) components.  
    
**Testing**

  Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security.       Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
